&lt;p&gt;Bryson and I picked out a bed from Maroochydore Lakeside Mobility along with matterss, side protector and rolling pivoting table for mum. Will be delivered in first week of Jan 26. Paid in full today via bank xfer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tipped double room mattress over for mum as interim measure until has own bed installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phone message left by Meals on Wheels saying they attempted to deliver food parcels but no-one home. Tried calling back but no answer.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Bryson Takes an Ambo Ride</title><link>https://mahiequalslollies.com/hugo/p/bryson-takes-an-ambo-ride/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 05:34:57 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://mahiequalslollies.com/hugo/p/bryson-takes-an-ambo-ride/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Bryson just called to say he is waiting on an ambulance. He is in &amp;lsquo;severe pain&amp;rsquo;. We didn&amp;rsquo;t go into details but he wanted to say that the key to the house is under the stereo out the back in the cabinet. He will call as soon as he can with an update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mum called shortly after. Is having crushing abdmoinal pains which nurses and staff have said relates to trapped gas. Nurse last night recommended she try and sleep on left side as that is the side the stomach is on and this will help push the gas out. Mum did - and sharted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mum cannot be released home if no-one is home. I said I can&amp;rsquo;t be there as place infested. Mum said Bruce suggested, when he visited her recently, that they shoud bomb the place. Use something available form Bunnings. I suggested that even if mum (and Bryson if it comes to it) stay in respite care for the duration this was a &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;: mum just texted to say she has asked Bruce to bomb the house while they are away.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mechanical Bed for Mum</title><link>https://mahiequalslollies.com/hugo/p/mechanical-bed-for-mum/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 15:38:00 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://mahiequalslollies.com/hugo/p/mechanical-bed-for-mum/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Bryson called me asking me to make enquiries about getting a mechanical bed for mum. Even suggested we get it before she leaves SCUH this time. I balked a little at this but TBH am thrilled that he is on-board with the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is one I have floated previously to both BJ and mum and received luke warm to cold response. I had once again promoted the idea gently to both mum and BJ today and have received a more positive response. Maybe the time has come for getting a few things done at Cooroora to provide a higher level of safety and care for mum. No more sleeping half the night in shared bed then awakeing in small hours in pain and finishing rest of night sat in lounge dozing or fully awake. Then sleeping during the day.&lt;/p&gt;

She has a tube going up her nse and down her throat (forget why) and a catheter. She is being fed liquids currently including jelly, creamed rice, custard etc but sais she can&amp;rsquo;t eat them as they are &amp;ldquo;too sweet&amp;rdquo;. This from a woman known for her sweet tooth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She sounds spirited and well though and accepting of the fact that she may not return home unti after Christmas. She is still having abdominal pain and is not yet fit to return hoe so it&amp;rsquo;s good that SCUH are taking good care of her.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mum Sick Returns via Ambulance to Nambour Hospital</title><link>https://mahiequalslollies.com/hugo/p/mum-sick-returns-via-ambulance-to-nambour-hospital/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 08:40:42 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://mahiequalslollies.com/hugo/p/mum-sick-returns-via-ambulance-to-nambour-hospital/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://mahiequalslollies.com/hugo/p/mum-sick-returns-via-ambulance-to-nambour-hospital/appendicitus-woman-grimacing.png"
