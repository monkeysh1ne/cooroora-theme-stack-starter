Having been vomitting and sleeping in turn all of yesterday an ambulance was called to have her returned to Nambour Hosital.  Symtoms included:
- vomitting and nausea
- loss of apetite
- unable to take solids
- barely able to take liquids
- loss of bowel control due to vomiting spasm at one point in evening
- cramping and sharp pains in abdominal area

Later in the day (apx 3pm) mum called me to report it was diagnosed as appendicitis!  She is to be transported to SCUH for surgery later today.
