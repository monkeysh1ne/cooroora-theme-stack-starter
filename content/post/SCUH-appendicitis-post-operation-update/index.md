So mum called to say the keyhole surgery performed at SCUH was a success!  She has a tube going up her nse and down her throat (forget why) and a catheter.  She is being fed liquids currently including jelly, creamed rice, custard etc but sais she can't eat them as they are "too sweet".  This from a woman known for her sweet tooth!

She sounds spirited and well though and accepting of the fact that she may not return home unti after Christmas.  She is still having abdominal pain and is not yet fit to return hoe so it's good that SCUH are taking good care of her.
