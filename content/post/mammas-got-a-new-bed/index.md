Bryson and I picked out a bed from Maroochydore Lakeside Mobility along with matterss, side protector and rolling pivoting table for mum.  Will be delivered in first week of Jan 26.  Paid in full today via bank xfer.

Tipped double room mattress over for mum as interim measure until has own bed installed.

Phone message left by Meals on Wheels saying they attempted to deliver food parcels but no-one home.  Tried calling back but no answer.
